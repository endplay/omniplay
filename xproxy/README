1.HOW TO BUILD
===============================
xproxy is written in c++, so make sure you have a c++ compiler like g++.
The following libraries is required to build it:
          lzo2 (liblzo2-dev package in ubuntu)
	  X11 library (libX11-dev package in ubuntu)
These two libraries should be enough to build xproxy on most machines, but if any other header file is missing, make sure the library containing that header file is installed.

***IMPORTANT***
The following steps may take a while, but it ensures the correctness of xproxy. 
Opcodes for x extensions on each machine may be different. (But since we are using the same version of ubuntu, they are likely to be the same on different machines).
So check util.H file in x proxy source directory. Line 40 to line 73 are for x extension opcodes. If you are installing x proxy on virtual machines, line 40 to line 57 should be used and line 58-74 should be commented out. If not, don't change these lines and continue. 

After you check util.H, then run:
xdpyinfo -queryExtensions | grep "opcode"
Unfortunately, now you have to double check opcodes defined in util.H manually... (I need to write a script or detect opcodes dynamically in the future...). Make sure opcodes defined in util.H for each extension is the same with that in the output from xdpyinfo command. (XE_SGI_SLX in util.H may refer to NV-SLX extension in your machine, as it's related to the graphic cards.) The number of opcodes in util.H is less than it from xdpyinfo command and it's okay. 
	

2. HOW TO USE
===============================
There are three modes for xproxy, and use regular mode if you just want to collect some data or replay a program normally:

a) regular mode
-------------------

This mode enables xproxy to work with replay system. 
Make sure FILE_REPLAY and CONVERT is off in util.H in xproxy source folder before you compile the xproxy (they are off by default). And also make sure LOG_COMPRESS and X_COMPRESS is on in kernel/replay.c of our replay system. 

	-------------------
	Recording:
	-------------------
	Before you start to record a process with xproxy, make sure /proc/sys/kernel/x_proxy is set to 1. 
	Run xproxy:
		user@machine$ ./xproxy > /dev/null &

	(Currently xproxy prints out a lot debugging information and after recording for a whole day, the debugging information will be huge. For now, I just drop all those debugging information by writing to /dev/null, and I will clean up the code or set up debugging level later on. )
	Then set DISPLAY environment variable to be :8.0 and start recording. For example:
		user@machine$ DISPLAY=:8.0
		user@machine$ ./launcher <your program>

	-------------------
	Replaying with xproxy:
	-------------------
	Make sure xproxy is still running. Then, 
		user@machine$ ./resume <recorded program>
	DISPLAY doesn't need to be set at this time. The recorded program saves the original DISPLAY=:8.0 value automatically during recording, as environment variables are non-deterministic sources and our replay system should have logged them. Now during replaying, you should be able to see the application pops up a window and starts to behave by itself.

	-------------------
	Replaying without xproxy:
	-------------------
	Set /proc/sys/kernel/x_proxy to be 0 and /proc/sys/kernel/record_x to be 1. 
	Then make sure xproxy is closed, otherwise the replayed program will still try to connect to :8.0 display as explained above. After xproxy is closed, the :8.0 display is a direct connection to x server. 
	( I can hack it later if anyone needs xproxy to be running in background for some recorded programs while replaying some other programs without xproxy.)

	-------------------
	Location of x logs:
	-------------------

	All x logs from xproxy resides in the same directory with xproxy binary. And the folder for the log of each replay group have the same name with the one in /replay_logdb, e.g. rec_4097, rec_9834. 
	In each folder, there are five types of files:
	reply.log.id.<pid>.<connection>	This file contains all necessary x reply messages that we must keep. A process may connect to x server several times during execution, so the last number of the log file name reflects the sequence of the connections.
	Event.log.id.<pid>.<connection> and error.log.id.<pid>.<connection>	These two files contains all necessary x event and error messages. Most recorded programs don't generate error.log.id.
	Reply.log.id.debug.<pid>.<connection>	This file contains all x messages that we can discard and these messages are not necessary for a faithful replay. The xproxy will make sure these messages can be regenerated during replaying and modify regenerated messages if there are non-determinisms. 
	Request.log.id.debug.<pid>.<connection>	Debugging purpose only. 

	-------------------
	How to know the size of logs that we can discard by using xproxy?
	-------------------
	Just look at the size of reply.log.id.debug.<pid>.<connection> files. That size is exactly the size of logs that we can discard. If a process has several connections to the x server and produces several reply.log.id.debug files, you should sum up the size of these files. 
	If you add the size of reply.log.id.debug, reply.log.id, event.log.id and error.log.id files all together (ignore request.log.id.debug files), you can get total size of x messages inside our kernel replay log (klog.id). 

	
b) file replay mode
-------------------
	
This mode can log all x messages for a non-recorded program and then it can replay all user activities without using our replay system.
Turn FILE_REPLAY on in util.H before using this mode and add -r option when you want to replay a “x recorded” process. 

c) convert mode
-------------------
	
This mode can regenerate compressed x logs during replaying if you don't run the xproxy during recording. 
Turn CONVERT on in util.H before using. 
Set /proc/sys/kernel/x_proxy to be 2.
Run xproxy as normal. 
Replay the program and xproxy should regenerate the compressed x logs. 
Note: This mode is not stable, and I only test firefox and a few other simple GUI applications.
